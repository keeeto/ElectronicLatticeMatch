# Ask Keith for e.g. matplotlib script for band alignment diagrams
# Or use: https://github.com/utf/bapt

# Enter if absorber is p- or n-type - set plot colours based on this (red for p-type absorber, blue for junction partner candidates and vice versa to match write up)

# Enter EA and IP of absorber
# Enter EA and IPs of junction partner candidates

# Generate colour-coded plot for absorber band alignment to all min strain junction partner candidates (gradient of colour linked to min possible strain?)

# Modify this e.g. to have more ids for red and blue colours? - https://github.com/utf/bapt/blob/master/examples/gradients.yaml
