# Ask Keith for e.g. matplotlib script for band alignment diagrams

# Enter if absorber is p- or n-type - set plot colours based on this (red for p-type absorber, blue for junction partner candidates and vice versa to match write up)

# Enter EA and IP of absorber
# Enter EA and IPs of junction partner candidates

# Generate colour-coded plot for absorber band alignment to all min strain junction partner candidates (gradient of colour linked to min possible strain?)
